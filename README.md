# Random String Generator

This Go program generates a list of random strings based on a pattern specified by the user. The program can be useful for generating lists of passwords, usernames, or other types of random strings for testing or other purposes.

## Getting Started

To use this program, you'll need to have Go installed on your computer. You can download Go from the official website: https://golang.org/dl/.

Once you have Go installed, you can download or clone this repository to your computer.

## Usage

To generate a list of random strings, you'll need to edit the `pattern` variable in the `main` function of the `main.go` file. The pattern specifies the format of the strings that will be generated. The following characters can be used in the pattern:

- `L` for lowercase letters
- `U` for uppercase letters
- `D` for digits
- `R` for any of the above (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, or digits)
- Any other character will be included as-is in the generated strings.

For example, the pattern `"L-L"` will generate strings consisting of two lowercase letters separated by a dash.

After editing the `pattern` variable, you can run the program by executing the following command in the terminal:

```go run main.go```

The program will generate a file called `random_strings.txt` containing the list of generated strings.
